## See it live [here](http://quiz-app.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).

## Deliverables
### Requirements documentation
* The final project completed is a web-based application. More specifically, it is a testing tool that’s function is the managing, administration, and taking of multiple-choice and true-false examinations. The goal of the project is to create a testing system, which includes a user component, where one can take any number of assigned tests, receiving said results, as well as viewing results of previously taken tests. The testing system also includes an administrative component where one can create, read, update and delete all types of users, questions (answers), and tests – as well as view user’s results.
* More specific requirements include: users are identified by and login through an email and password; users can be marked inactive by an administrator and are therefore not allowed to login; users are emailed their identification information upon account creation by an administrator; questions are to be categorized and can contain images as well as text; upon taking a test, a user’s progress should be saved actively as they answer questions; the header image, header text, and footer text should be customizable by each administrator; a test with questions and answers can be uploaded to the web-app in the form of a csv file, propagating through the database.

### Product Backlog
* The priority of the stories goes top -> bottom, and the number at the beginning of each card title is the story point, however, they are also available as tags for each trello item. Thank you.

* See [Product Backlog PDF](https://github.com/lprescott/ICSI418-Group-Project/blob/master/project-logistics/Product-Backlog.pdf)

### Project Plan with Sprints
* The priority of the tasks goes top -> bottom; the labels determine which sprint a task is part of; the product backlog (column 1) determines the due date of these sprints by said tags. The five agile columns we have in our project plan are: Product Backlog, Not Started, In Development, To Verify, and Done.
